-- Meeting 3/9 Minutes/Notes

-- Today:
---- Working on UML diagramming for Ben
----
---- Will's Ideas on Loading:
---- " " courses = new
---- Dictionary contacts = new
---- Dictionary Notes = new
---- load in object
---- (
---- )
---- if obj == notes {
      ArrangeNotes(Note, noteDict)
      }
---- if obj == Contacts {
      ArrangeContact(Contact, contactDict)
      }
---- if obj == Course {
      ArrangeCourses(Course, courseDict)
      }
----
---- Arrange(obj, Dictionary) {
      getTagFromObj()
      if tag == "null" {
        Add to misc Array List
        }
      else {
          if (cat does not exist in dictionary) {
            create New Array List
            create New Dictionary With Cat Name
            add Item To Array List For That Cat
          }
          else {
            get array list for that cat
            add item to that cat's array list
          }
        }
      }
    (tag, array list)

    (tagname) ---- [][][][][][][][][][][]
              \---[][][][][][][][][][][][]

    on search load
    map.getKeys()
    pick key(tag)
    pull that array list
    load all or search through it
    or search by name through list
