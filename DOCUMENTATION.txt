+ Instructions for downloading and getting started in Eclipse.

To get running in Eclipse:

    -- Clone the repo into your workspace that Eclipse is using
    -- In the project explorer window
    ---- File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace
    ---- Make sure "Select root directory" is checked
    ---- Click "Browse" and navigate to the project folder.
    ---- Click Finish, and you should be good to go.

+ Management subject to change

Project Management:

    -- Branch : master
    ---- Master is basically a 'production line'
    ---- Please reserve it for working copies of the project

    -- Right now,
    ---- Make yourself a branch, and work in that instead
    ---- As  stated above, this may be subject to change, if it gets too much of a hassle,
          we'll work purely out of master

Package Structure:

    -- pip's package structure is as follows (subject to change):
    ---- gui --> all graphical user interface components
    ---- com --> components like Note, CalendarEvent go here
    ---- util --> helper classes
    ---- app --> package containing the code that will actually start the
                 program, may be scrapped in the end
